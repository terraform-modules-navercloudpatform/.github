## About

This repository hosts a collection of Terraform modules specifically designed for the Naver Cloud Platform. These modules are maintained by the community and aim to provide reusable patterns, simplify complex setups, and foster code sharing across different projects.

## Modules

Each module in this repository is organized into its own directory, where you'll find all the necessary files to get started, including:

- `README.md`: Detailed documentation about the module, usage examples, and configuration options.
- `main.tf`: The primary Terraform configuration file for the module.
- `variables.tf`: Definitions of variables used in the module.
- `outputs.tf`: Outputs after module deployment.

Explore the directories to find the module that fits your needs.
